### API Responses
Always respond with JSON, keep single structure:

1. result: "successful" or "error", just one of these two strings
2. message: A string according to the case, never an empty string
3. data: According to the case or None, only one of these two options

Sample of a successful case:
```
    {"result": "successful", "message": "Done", "data": None}
```

Sample of an error case:
```
    {"result": "error", "message": "Underdone", "data": None}

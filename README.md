# Welcome
:man_technologist: In 2019 I joined to the school of computer science and software development 'Holberton School' to the foundation program and I currently dedicate all my time to study the specialization in Full-Stack Web Development and to train myself as a software engineer to obtain my first formal job as programmer.  
Is there any job opportunity for me? [Contact me](https://www.javierandresgp.com)

### Terms and concepts
Problem solving is the core thing software developers do.  The programming 
languages and tools they use are secondary to this fundamental skill.

#### Introduction to Programming and Computer Science
- Introduction
- What is programming?
- How do we write code?
- How do we get information from computers?
- What can Computer's do?
- What are variables?
- How do we manipulate variables?
- What are conditional statements?
- What are arrays?
- What are loops?
- What are errors?
- How do we debug code?
- What are functions?
- How can we import functions?
- How do we make our own functions?
- What are array lists and dictionaries?
- How can we use data structures?
- What is recursion?
- What is pseudocode?
- Choosing the right language?
- Applications of programming
##### SOLID Principles
* Single Responsibility Principle
  - One task, only one responsibility.
* Open/Close Principle
  - Open for extensión, close for modification.
* Liskov Substitution Principle
  - Every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.
* Interface Segregation Principle
  - Only require what is used.
* Dependency Inversion Principle
  - Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
